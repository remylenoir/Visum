# VISUM

## Introduction

Visum allows you to visualize insightful & real data of New York City.  
This app was made with [@roosterhack](https://github.com/roosterhack) during the second module of the [Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/en), in a time span of 4 days.

###### What the app is about?

The initial idea was to create an app where you could compare cities based on their data, visualize the data as layers displayed on the map and also animate real time data from public transportation using [gtfs](https://gtfs.org/) ([see an example](https://hvv.live/)).  

We have decided to exclude the compare and animation features from the MVP and focus our work on displaying the data with one city.

## Challenges:

###### Data gathering

One of the biggest challenges was to gather the data in the correct format (.geojson), with proper set of coordinates. We had to reject most of the data we wanted to display (i.e. Crime rate) because the available data was given as an .xls file without any coordinates, it would have took us more time to display it in a proper way.

###### Data displaying

We wanted to display the data in it's best way, we had to analyse the data and choose how to highlight it (with color fill, lines, heatmap, interactive clustersâ€¦).
